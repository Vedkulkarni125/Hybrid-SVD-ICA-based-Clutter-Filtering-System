Developed a real-time Hybrid SVD–ICA Clutter Filtering pipeline for Ultrafast Doppler Ultrasound using CUDA and MATLAB to significantly improve blood-flow visualization by removing strong tissue-motion artifacts that are 40–60 dB louder than Doppler signals. The system combines GPU-accelerated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for fast removal of high-energy clutter with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to eliminate residual periodic tissue noise. Implemented a custom CUDA C++ MEX interface using cuSOLVER (cusolverDnZgesvd) to perform heavy 𝑂(𝑁3)O(N3)matrix factorizations on the GPU, while MATLAB handled data ingestion, tensor reshaping, rank-threshold filtering, ICA (FastICA), and Power Doppler reconstruction. By reducing the signal dimensions through GPU-SVD before applying ICA, the hybrid model achieves faster convergence, cleaner Doppler images, and superior clutter suppression compared to standalone SVD. Successfully integrated MATLAB, CUDA, and Visual Studio toolchains, managing GPU memory, indexing, and compatibility challenges. Future improvements include porting ICA to full GPU kernels and validating performance on in-vivo ultrasound datasets.
